\section{Non-goal-driven Systems} \label{Non-goal-driven Systems}

Non-goal-driven systems usually accomplish NLU, DM, and NLG jointly. Historically, they start as rule-based systems, such as ELIZA \cite{Weizenbaum1966Eliza} and ALICE \footnote{http://www.alicebot.org/}. As the amount of conversational corpus becomes large, data-driven systems have been researched since 2011 \cite{Ritter2011Data}. The methods used in data-driven systems fall into two categories: (1) Retrieval-based methods \cite{Ji2014An, Yan2016DocChat}; (2) Generation-based methods \cite{Ritter2011Data, Shang2015Neural, Sordoni2015a, Serban2016}. Non-goal-driven systems may be useful for goal-oriented systems when they are trained on corpus related to the tasks of goal-oriented systems: (1) They can be used as user simulator to construct large task-specific corpus; (2) They may directly act as goal-oriented systems \cite{Vinyals2015A}.
