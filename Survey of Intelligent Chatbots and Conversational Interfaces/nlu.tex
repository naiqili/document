\section{Natural Language Understanding}

The \emph{NLU (natural language understanding)} component of dialogue system produces a semantic representation which is appropriate for the dialogue task. Many speech-based dialogue systems are based on the frame-and-slot semantics \cite{Jurafsky2006}. In this circumstance, the task of NLU is equivalent to filling each slot with the correct value, given the information from the upstream ASR component.

In this section, we begin with presenting some classic approaches for NLU, based on rules, grammar and statistic learning \cite{Miller1996,Pieraccini1994,Ward1994}. Although these methods look simple, they suffice to build several non-trivial dialogue systems that are deployed in real world. The work of Rayner \cite{Rayner2003} aims to proposed a method that can combine both the power of rule-based and data-driven approaches. Several other deep learning techniques proposed recently are also closely related with the NLU component \cite{Hermann2013, Kalchbrenner2013}.

In another line of research, NLU is not restricted to discover merely the value of each slot, but take a more ambitious step to translate the given natural sentence to formal logic or database queries \cite{Grefenstette2014}. These NLU techniques are not yet widely applied in SDS.

Another subject closely related to NLU is called the \emph{dialogue state tracking challenge (DSTC)}. We conclude this section with a paper that address the challenge with LSTM network \cite{Zilka2015} which shows that the NLU component is not always necessary.
