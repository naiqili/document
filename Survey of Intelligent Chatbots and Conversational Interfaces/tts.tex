\section{Text-to-speech Synthesis} \label{Text-to-speech Synthesis}

The goal of the TTS component is to map a text to a waveform output. Speech synthesis systems typically perform this mapping in two steps, first converting the input text into a phonemic internal representation and then converting this internal representation into a waveform \cite{Jurafsky2006}.

We begin this section with a brief survey of the mature approach that are widely applied in commercial systems \cite{Jurafsky2006}. The most successful TTS systems that are widely used in commercial systems generally follow two approaches: the HMM-based method, and the unit selection method \cite{Black97}. When the TTS system is used in a limited domain (e.g. a weather report system), it is possible to make the voice more natural with some special techniques \cite{Black2000}. In the last paper, we introduce an end-to-end TTS system that works without explicit internal representation \cite{Wu2016Investigating}. This new line of research still awaits to be further explored, and is not among the mainstreams of commercial TTS systems.
