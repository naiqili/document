\subsection{Word-based dialog state tracking with recurrent neural networks \cite{Henderson2014Word}}

The task is to converts user inputs into dialogue states (see Table \ref{Goal-Oriented Dialogue System Example} for an example of dialogue state). The dialogue state is a probability distribution over handcrafted goals, methods, and requested slots. The paper uses a RNN to compute the distribution over goal values for each goal, a RNN to compute the distribution over methods, and a RNN to compute the distribution over requested slots. During training, gradient clipping is used to avoid exploding gradients \cite{Pascanu2012Understanding}.
