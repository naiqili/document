\subsection{On-line policy optimisation of Bayesian spoken dialogue systems via human interaction \cite{Gasic2011}.}

The task is to learn system policy, which determines system acts based on dialouge states (see Table \ref{Goal-Oriented Dialogue System Example} for an example). The paper applies GP-Sarsa to automatic policy learning, which is an online RL algorithms based on Gaussian process \cite{Engel2014Reinforcement}. The GP-Sarsa optimization adopts a more robust filtered reward function \cite{Gasic2011}.
