  System & Year & Task Description & Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) & Text-to-speech (TTS) & Dialogue Manager (DM) & Natural Language Understanding (NLU) & Natural Language Generation (NLG) & Training Data \\
  \hline
  ConQuest \cite{Bohus2007} & 2007 & Provides technical program information during conferences. Deployed in InterSpeech 2006 and IJCAI 2007. & CMU Sphinx2 \cite{Huang1993}. & Cepstral speech synthesis engine (http://www.cepstral.com). & RavenClaw architecture \cite{Bohus2003}. & Phoenix semantic parser \cite{Ward1994}. & Rosetta, a template-based NLG component. 	& Training data is only used for ASR. It starts with data collected by a text-only prototype. After deployment they collected more data, transcribed it, and retrain the LM. LM used in InterSpeech 2006 were trained on a corpus of 6350 utterances. \\
  \hline
  Let's DiSCoH \cite{Lemon2006} &	2006 &	Users are able to call to learn about a conference, including paper submission, program, venue, etc. Designed to be highly portable and flexible across different conferences and workshops. & \multicolumn{5}{l|}{System developed using the AT\&T VoiceTone Spoken Dialogue System tools \cite{Gilbert2005}, which provides services with ASR, SLU, DM and TTS. System uses a fixed set of responses so no NLG component is mentioned.} &	{LM trained by W99 dataset + artificially generated + data from conference website + manually designed (11,275 + 9,511 + 226 + 467 sentences).} \\
  \hline
  Let's Go \cite{Raux2005} & 2005 & Provide bus schedule information to the Pittsburgh population during off-peak times. & CMU Sphinx2. &	Techniques in Limited Domain Synthesis \cite{Black2000}. Unit selection concatenative voice specifically designed for domain. &	RavenClaw architecture.  &	Initially uses hand-coded Finite State Grammars. Finally uses tri-gram language models trained on artificial corpora. &	Rosetta. &	Data from real world: 614 dialogues, containing 7936 user turns. Manually transcribed and labeled. \\
  \hline
  LARRI \cite{Bohus2002} &	2002 &	A multi-modal system for support of maintenance and repair activities for aircraft mechanics. &	CMU Sphinx2. &	Festival system in a limited domain mode. Use unit-selection synthesizer with a fall back on a diphone voice. &	Behavior is specified through a task-dependent script. AGENDA dialogue manager \cite{Rudnicky1999a}. &	Phoenix semantic parser. &	Rosetta. &	AM trained with WSJ0 corpus. Trigram LM trained with INS BIT Test procedure and general system commands.\\
  \hline
  NJFun \cite{Singh2002} &	2002 &	Provide telephone access to a database of activities in New Jersey. &	Watson Speech Recognizer. &	Concatenative diphone synthesis method. &	Train by reinforcement learning (MDP) Build with DMD scripting language \cite{Levin2003}.	& Watson Speech Recognizer. &	Grammar and template. &	Manually obtained by AT\&T employees. 54 subjects for training and 21 for testing. 311 training dialogues, 124 testing dialogues.\\
