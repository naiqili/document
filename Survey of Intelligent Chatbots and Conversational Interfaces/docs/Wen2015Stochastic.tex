\subsection{Stochastic language generation in dialogue using recurrent neural networks with convolutional sentence reranking \cite{Wen2015a}}

The task is to maps system acts into surface texts. The paper uses RNN LM to generate responses by sampling words from the predicted distribution conditioned on dialogue acts. After generating response candidates, CNN and RNN are used together to score and rerank the candidates.
