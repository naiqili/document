\subsection{Building end-to-end dialogue systems using generative hierarchical neural network models \cite{Serban2016}}

The task is to build end-to-end trainable chatbots that can have open-domain conversations. The paper applies HRED \cite{Sordoni2015a}, which uses encoder GRU \cite{Chung2014Empirical, Cho2014Learning} to encode the input utterance to an utterance vector, uses context GRU to map the utterance vector to a context vector, and uses decoder GRU to decode the context vector to generate the output response. The chatbots are improved by bootstrapping word embeddings from large news datasets with word2vec \cite{Mikolov2014Empirical}, or by pretraining model parameters on large QA datasets. The chatbots can also benefit from using bidirectional RNN \cite{Sundermeyer2014Translation}.
